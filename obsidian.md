# Obsidian CLI

## Official CLI (Released Feb 10, 2026)

Obsidian v1.12.0 introduced an official CLI with 100+ commands.

**Key benefits:**
- Terminal-based vault operations without GUI
- Automation and scripting support
- AI tool integration (e.g., Claude Code can manipulate vault directly)
- Template application, task management via command line
- TUI mode for remote SSH access

**Current status:** Early Access (requires Catalyst license $25), planned free release later.

## Why It Benefits This Repo

**Direct manipulation:**
- Create/edit notes from terminal/scripts
- Query vault contents programmatically
- Automate note organization and linking

**Integration with workflows:**
- Add programming notes during CLI sessions
- Script-based note generation from code analysis
- Automated knowledge base updates

**Remote access:**
- Edit vault via SSH without GUI
- Terminal-only environments (servers, remote dev boxes)

## Community Tools

Alternative/supplemental CLI tools:
- **[notesmd-cli](https://github.com/Yakitrak/notesmd-cli)**: Works without Obsidian running, good for pure automation
- **[obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export)**: Export vault to CommonMark
- **[obsidian-cli](https://github.com/mcky/obsidian-cli)**: Query and interact with vault data
